This is a code's aim is Speech Enhancement and Denoising Audio For Hard-of-Hearing People In Universities.
The main idea is to fine tune existing pre-trained MetricGAN+ model from speechbrain (https://speechbrain.github.io/; https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain).
Fine tunning is made on custom data.
Main methods are: 
-  Spectral Masking
-  Spectral mapping
-  Signal approximation
-  Metric Generative adversarial networks (MetricGAN)
-  Bidirectional Long short term memory (BLSTM)
